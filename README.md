# cloudcore
A cloud-based, open source IoT device management solution.  

## Goals
* Simple minimal agent and management interface.
* Provide extensions and customization through plugins.
* Provide direct access to one or more raw `net.Conn` (multiplexed) for every agent for maximum flexibility.
* Out-of-the-box support for common features like SSH access.
